Yarn
====
Yarn is the softest, squishiest temporal logic there is. It is pull-based FRP 
library for varying data over time - much like wires or netwire. In fact the
types are almost identical to wires and as such the implementation is similar.
Differences start to appear in the way signals are combined, switched and 
chained together.

Yarn aims to be well documented and to have easy to follow function names, 
operators and patterns. This is very alpha, but works! Examples, tutorials and 
wiki are in the works.
